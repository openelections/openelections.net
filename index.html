        <h3>Welcome to OpenElections</h3>

<p>Our goal is to create the first free, comprehensive, standardized, linked set of election data for the United States, including federal and statewide offices.</p>

<h3>Ok, But Why?</h3>

<p>No freely available comprehensive source of official election results exists. The current options for election data can be difficult to find and use or financially out-of-reach for most journalists and civic hackers. We want the people who work with election data to be able to get what they need, whether that's a CSV file for stories and data analysis or JSON usable for web applications and interactive graphics.</p>

<h3>Who Are You?</h3>

<p>Project leads are Serdar Tumgoren, Senior Developer at The Washington Post, and Derek Willis, Interactive Developer at The New York Times. OpenElections isn't a project of those companies, but we both work on elections in our day jobs.</p>

<p>OpenElections is generously supported by the <a href="http://www.knightfoundation.org/press-room/press-release/six-ventures-bring-data-public-winners-knight-news/">John S. and James L. Knight Foundationâ€™s Knight News Challenge</a>.</p>

<h3>How Can I Get Involved?</h3>

<p>We'll be <a href="https://github.com/organizations/openelections">posting our code</a> on Github. There's also a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/openelections">Google Group</a> for questions and updates. Or <a href="http://twitter.com/openelex">follow us</a> on Twitter.</p>
