The current options for election data can be difficult to find and use or financially out-of-reach for most journalists and civic hackers. We want the people who work with election data to be able to get what they need, whether that's a CSV file for stories and data analysis or JSON usable for web applications and interactive graphics.\r\n\r\n### Who Are You?\r\nProject leads are Serdar Tumgoren, Senior Developer at The Washington Post, and Derek Willis, Interactive Developer at The New York Times. OpenElections isn't a project of those companies, but we both work on elections in our day jobs.\r\n\r\nOpenElections is generously supported by the [John S. and James L. Knight Foundationâ€™s Knight News Challenge](http://www.knightfoundation.org/press-room/press-release/six-ventures-bring-data-public-winners-knight-news/).\r\n\r\n### How Can I Get Involved?\r\nWe'll be [posting our code](https://github.com/organizations/openelections) on Github. There's also a [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/openelections) for questions and updates. Or [follow us](http://twitter.com/openelex) on Twitter.","tagline":"Certified election results. For everyone."}
