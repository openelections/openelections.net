For Everyone.","name":"OpenElections.net","body":"### Welcome to OpenElections\r\nOur goal is to create the first free, comprehensive, standardized, linked set of election data for the United States, including federal and statewide offices.\r\n\r\n### Ok, But Why?\r\nNo freely available comprehensive source of official election results exists. The current options for election data can be difficult to find and use or financially out-of-reach for most journalists and civic hackers. We'll change that.\r\n\r\n### Who Are You?\r\nProject leads are Serdar Tumgoren, Senior Developer at The Washington Post, and Derek Willis, Interactive Developer at The New York Times. OpenElections isn't a project of those companies, but we both work on elections in our day jobs."}
